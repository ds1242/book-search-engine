 # Book Search Engine ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## About/Description

  This is a book search engine that uses the Google book api to pull book information.  The starter code of the project provided a working application and the purpose of the project was to replace the RESTful API with a GraphQL API and use Apollo Provider to modify existing middleware to enable the use of JWT.  The application was then redeployed with Heroku.
